If you want to stay with your basic plan. üí™ We suggest to go to the tabac the day before you launch the program. Buy as much cigarettes that you will need. The app will tell you the exact number and guide you. Then ask to a member of your family to fill your packet the morning with the right amount of cigarettes for the day.
